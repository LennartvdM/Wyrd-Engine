# Synthetic Calendar Generator

Generate believable, minute-by-minute weekly schedules for fictional characters. The project now
ships with a stochastic "workforce" engine for archetype-driven experiments alongside the original
configuration-based MVP and a browser playground.

## Quick start

### Workforce simulation CLI

```bash
python calendar_gen_v2.py --archetype office --output schedule.json --seed 7
```

The workforce generator never fails outright: it always produces a schedule, logs any issues it
finds, and reports the weekly activity budget it actually achieved. Choose from the built-in
`office`, `parent`, or `freelancer` archetypes (or extend `archetypes.py` with your own) and tweak
the random seed to explore different weeks.

### Configuration-driven CLI

```bash
python calendar_gen.py path/to/config.json output.json
```

The original deterministic MVP remains available when you need to supply an explicit schedule
configuration. It validates the input against strict 24-hour days and is useful for regression
checks.

### Browser UI

Open `web/index.html` in any modern browser (or deploy the `web/` directory to a static host such as
Netlify) to experiment with schedules visually. The interface mirrors the Python logic, renders
colour-coded timelines, and lets you download the resulting JSON.
