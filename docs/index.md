# Wyrd Engine Documentation

Welcome to the Wyrd Engine documentation hub. Start here to understand the project goals, explore its simulation components, and find links to deeper technical references.

## Overview

Wyrd Engine experiments with procedural world-building tools that generate believable daily routines, economic rhythms, and other systemic narratives for fictional settings. Each component favours iterative design: we release a working version, capture lessons from production use, and refine the architecture without discarding the valuable pieces.

For quick setup instructions and deployment tips, see the [usage guide](./usage.md).

## Component Deep Dives

- **Calendar Generator** — [Architecture Evolution](./calendar-generator/architecture-evolution.md)
  - [Algorithm Comparison](./calendar-generator/algorithm-comparison.md)
  - [Technical Reference](./calendar-generator/technical-reference.md)
- *(Reserved)* Other components will gain their own folders and deep dives as they mature.

## How to Contribute

This is a solo-maintained project, so documentation updates are intentionally lightweight. If you find gaps or have questions, please open an issue describing what information would help you evaluate or extend the engine.
