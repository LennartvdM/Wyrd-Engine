Generates minute-by-minute weekly schedules for NPCs. Configure sleep, work, meals, and activitiesâ€”get back a valid 24-hour timeline with no gaps or overlaps.

## Usage

```bash
python calendar_gen.py path/to/config.json output.json
```

The generator outputs a JSON file containing the full week of events and prints
summary totals (sleep, work, meals, activities, and free time) to the console.

Configuration files follow the example described in `calendar_gen.py` and the
project specification.

## Web interface

A zero-dependency web UI that mirrors the Python logic lives in `web/`. You can
open `web/index.html` directly in a browser or deploy the folder to Netlify (or
any static host). The page accepts the same configuration JSON, renders a
colour-coded weekly timeline, lists all generated events, and lets you download
the output as a JSON file.

To preview locally without Netlify:

```bash
cd web
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then browse to <http://localhost:8000/>.
