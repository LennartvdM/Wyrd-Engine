# Synthetic Calendar Generator

Generates minute-by-minute weekly schedules for NPC-style characters based on a simple JSON
configuration. Every generated day totals 1,440 minutes with no gaps or overlaps so the routines
feel consistent and believable.

## Quick start

### Command-line tool

```bash
python calendar_gen.py path/to/config.json output.json
```

The CLI reads a character configuration, writes a full week of events to the output file, and prints
summary totals for sleep, work, meals, activities, and free time to the console.

### Browser UI

Open `web/index.html` in any modern browser (or deploy the `web/` directory to a static host such as
Netlify) to experiment with schedules visually. The interface mirrors the Python logic, renders
colour-coded timelines, and lets you download the resulting JSON.
