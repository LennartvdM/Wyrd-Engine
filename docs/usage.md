# Synthetic Calendar Generator Usage

This repository now contains two complementary Python entry points plus a static browser UI.

## Workforce simulation CLI

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # optional; a built-in NL holiday fallback is provided
python calendar_gen_v2.py --archetype office --output schedule.json --seed 42 --start-date 2025-12-22 \
  --yearly-budget examples/yearly_budget_alice.json
```

Pick an archetype (office, parent, freelancer) to load one of the persona budgets defined in
`archetypes.py`. The generator now anchors the schedule to the real calendar, so `--start-date`
accepts any ISO date (not just Mondays) and holiday/weekend logic adjusts behaviour automatically.
Supplying `--yearly-budget` allows you to load adâ€‘hoc unique days (vacations, sick leave, birthdays,
etc.) from JSON. The engine produces a JSON document that includes the full week of events, summary
hour totals, calendar-aware day types, and any warnings/errors discovered during validation. Adjust
the `--seed` parameter to explore different stochastic variations.

## Configuration-driven CLI

```bash
python calendar_gen.py path/to/config.json output.json
```

The deterministic MVP consumes the JSON configuration described in `calendar_gen.py` and writes a full
week of minute-by-minute events to the specified output file. It also prints summary totals for
sleep, work, meals, activities, and free time to the console.
This repository contains two ways to build a weekly schedule for a single NPC-style character.

## Command-line tool

```
python calendar_gen.py path/to/config.json output.json
```

The CLI consumes the JSON configuration described in `calendar_gen.py` and writes a full week of
minute-by-minute events to the specified output file. It also prints summary totals for sleep, work,
meals, activities, and free time to the console.

## Browser UI

A zero-dependency web UI that mirrors the Python logic lives in `web/`. Open `web/index.html`
directly in a browser or deploy the folder to any static host (for example, Netlify). The page
accepts the same configuration JSON, renders a colour-coded weekly timeline, lists the generated
events, and allows downloading the result as JSON.

To preview locally without an external host:

```bash
```
cd web
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then browse to <http://localhost:8000/>.
