# Wyrd Engine Wiki

Welcome to the collaborative knowledge base for the Wyrd Engine project. This wiki curates the
project's intent, core systems, and practical workflows so you can ramp up quickly or reference the
latest design decisions at a glance. For deeper technical write-ups, explore the Markdown documents
in the repository's [`docs/`](../index.md) folder.

## Project Snapshot
- **Mission:** Generate believable synthetic schedules and supporting world-building data for
  narrative prototypes and simulation-heavy games.
- **Current focus:** The workforce calendar generator that produces minute-by-minute weekly routines
  for personas such as office workers, exhausted parents, and night-owl freelancers. 【F:README.md†L5-L31】【F:engines/engine_mk2.py†L12-L66】

## Quick Links
- [Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md) — install prerequisites, run the CLIs, and explore the
  browser demo.
- [Calendar Generator](./Calendar-Generator.md) — architecture, personas, and seasonal modelling
  details.
- [Web Interface](./Web-Interface.md) — how the zero-dependency UI mirrors the Python generators.
- [Contributing Notes](./Contributing.md) — tips for filing issues or proposing enhancements.

## Staying in Sync
The wiki is intentionally lightweight. When you update or extend the engine, add a short note or
link here so the knowledge base stays discoverable. For long-form essays or design retrospectives,
prefer the version-controlled documents in `docs/` and add cross-links from the wiki instead of
duplicating content.
