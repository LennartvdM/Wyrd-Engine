# Wyrd Engine v3.0-modular

## Summary

The 3.0-modular release finalises the separation of engines, modules, and rigs. Documentation now reflects the architecture, and the unified CLI covers deterministic (MK1) and behavioural (MK2) workflows without breaking existing scripts.

## Highlights

- Added an `ARCHITECTURE.md` overview describing how engines, modules, and rigs collaborate.
- Updated the README with an evolution timeline and quickstarts for MK1, MK2 calendar, and MK2 workforce scenarios.
- Confirmed compatibility with legacy entry points (`calendar_gen.py`, `calendar_gen_v2.py`, `cli.py`).
- Published release notes for the modular launch and tagged the repository as `v3.0-modular`.

## Upgrade Notes

- Existing deterministic workflows continue to use MK1 via `SimpleRig`.
- Behavioural projects should switch to the unified `cli.py` interface to select calendar or workforce rigs as needed.
- Custom integrations can extend the new rig layer to mix additional modules without modifying engine code.
