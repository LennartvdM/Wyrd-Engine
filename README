Generates minute-by-minute weekly schedules for NPCs. Configure sleep, work, meals, and activitiesâ€”get back a valid 24-hour timeline with no gaps or overlaps.

## Usage

```bash
python calendar_gen.py path/to/config.json output.json
```

The generator outputs a JSON file containing the full week of events and prints
summary totals (sleep, work, meals, activities, and free time) to the console.

Configuration files follow the example described in `calendar_gen.py` and the
project specification.
