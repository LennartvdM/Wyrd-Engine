# Calendar Generator Algorithm Comparison

This page will catalogue the behavioural differences between the deterministic configuration pipeline and the stochastic workforce simulation.

- **MVP configuration engine**: deterministic, JSON-driven routines suited for regression tests and handcrafted personas.
- **Workforce simulation engine**: archetype-guided stochastic generation for exploring broader behavioural spaces.

Additional metrics, benchmarks, and visualisations will be added as they are produced during ongoing development.
